                information. The app offers multiple categories to choose from, such as geogrpahy or history,
                allowing people to learn something new, while competing for the top stop on the podium.</td>
            <td>Simply Piano is another good example of an engaging application.
                The user gradually moves through the tutorials and the difficulty of the music
                increases as they progress. The user also receives rewards for their progress, which
                enhances their motivation to keep going.</td>
            <td>This musical app for instruments such as guitars and drums, can be described as being
                engaging. Similarly to "Simply Piano", the user goes through a tutorial, can change the 
                difficulty, and play songs.
