            <td id="Good">Kahoot can easily be described as being engaging.
                The competitive atmosphere allows for people to enjoy the app
                information. The app offers multiple categories to choose from, such as geogrpahy or history,
                allowing people to learn something new, while competing for the top stop on the podium.
                (8/10)</td>
            <td id="Good">Simply Piano is another good example of an engaging application.
                The user gradually moves through the tutorials and the difficulty of the music
                increases as they progress. The user also receives rewards for their progress, which
                enhances their motivation to keep going. (8/10) </td>
            <td id="Good">This musical app for instruments such as guitars and drums, can be described as being
                engaging. Similarly to "Simply Piano", the user goes through a tutorial, can change the 
                difficulty, and play various songs depending on the difficulty. (8/10)</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Progress tracking: </td>
            <td id="Bad">Kahoot, although fun, unfortunately does not track the users progress.
                The app is purely for enjoyment purposes, especially in the school environment,
                but it isn't reliable for tracking progress or receiving any rewards. (3/10)</td>
            <td id="Good">Simply Piano does an excellent job at tracking the users progress. 
                Not only that, but you receive rewards for completing sections, such as medals.
                The app also offers the user more challenging music to play depending on their
                skill level. (9/10)</td>
            <td id="Good">Similarly to "Simply Piano", the app offers medals and other rewards to users
                who make steady progress. They can view their progress too and can change the 
                difficulty. (8/10)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>User-Experience</td>
            <td id="Good">Although there is a lack of rewards and progress tracking in Kahoot,
                it is safe to say the app is very fun to use. With the wide range of 
                educational categories to have quizzes on, and considering how popular
                the app is, the user user-experience is positive. (9/10)</td>
            <td id="Good">The interface uses a very simplistic, yet friendly and colourful style, and the progress
                is neatly organised in a line, like a metaphor for a path. Following the music on the app
                does not require a lot of thinking either, making it a fun experience for users. (8/10)</td>
            <td id="Okay">Yousician provides a simple and easy to follow interface too. It tracks the users progress,
                and allows people to play music with ease. However, at times, there can be issues where progres
                can be lost and subsriptions can be expensive. 
                In conclusion, Yousician provides a decent user-experience. (6/10)</td>
